# Prompt: Title & Subtitle Generator (Section-Header Aware)

## Objective

Generate **10 distinct title–subtitle** pairs for a given article.

- **Title**: capture the main hook from the introduction and/or the central problem or key consequence.
- **Subtitle**: expand the title with gentle, practical steps or principles and end with a natural motivational note.
- Silently read and synthesize the article’s **section headers** to understand structure and emphasis.

## Editorial References (tone & craft)

The New York Times, Bloomberg, POLITICO, NPR — aim for clarity, balance, and measured intrigue (no clickbait).

## Input

After this prompt, you will receive the article text following the token. Treat everything after the `## THE ARTICLE` as the article.

## Core Tasks (perform silently; do not print these steps)

1. Read the article. Extract the **hook** from the introduction.
2. Extract the **core conclusion** and any **call to action** from the ending.
3. Scan **section headers (H1–H3 and subheads, bold with empty lines before and after)** and build an internal (do not print) 3–5-point skeleton: problem → causes → consequences → solutions/principles.
4. Craft **titles** using varied angles (questions, benefits, pain/risks, consequences), grounded in the hook + skeleton + conclusion.
5. For each title, write a **subtitle** that:
   - Adds context without repeating wording from the title.
   - Offers a simple sequence of steps/principles (infinitives or gentle second-person suggestions).
   - Stays practical and non-pushy.
   - Ends with a motivational payoff or natural consequence.
6. Apply the **quality checklist** below and output only the required format.
