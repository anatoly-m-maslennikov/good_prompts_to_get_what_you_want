# Article Creation from Audio Transcript

## Task

Transform spoken audio transcripts into structured first-person articles in Russian that preserve the speaker's authentic voice and logical progression while making insights immediately actionable and emotionally resonant for a peer audience.

## Target Audience & Purpose

- **Audience**: Professionals in knowledge work, support, or management contexts (customer service, product, operations); people navigating workplace challenges; peers seeking tested, non-dogmatic wisdom
- **Purpose**: Share lived experience and practical patterns—not as prescription, but as "here's what worked for me" that readers can adapt
- **Reading context**: Thoughtful, standalone long-form content (Medium/Substack style); reflective and practical rather than entertaining

## Voice & Tone

- **First-person, grounded, conversational**: Write as if sharing hard-won insights with a colleague over coffee—natural, reflective, occasionally sardonic
- **Honest about complexity**: Acknowledge trade-offs, gray areas, and the fact that simple "do this" rules rarely work
- **Active, concrete language**: Use verbs and tangible examples; avoid abstract business-speak or soft motivational tone
- **Respectful of reader autonomy**: Frame insights as conditional ("if you're in this situation," "one approach is") rather than prescriptive commands
- **Spare use of technical terms**: Include domain-specific vocabulary naturally when it matters; define sparingly only when the speaker did
- **Avoid hedging and filler**: Strip phrases like "maybe," "it seems," "perhaps," "просто," "очевидно," or "всего-то" that weaken claims
- **Preserve humor and mild irreverence where authentic**: Allow the speaker's natural tone—including light profanity or skepticism—to come through

## Structural Principles

### Length-Based Selection

**For 3-5 minute audio:**

- Simple narrative arc; minimal section headers or none
- One continuous flow broken into natural thought units

**For 6+ minute audio:**

Analyze the logical progression and apply whichever template best fits the speaker's thinking:

**Template A: Problem → Analysis → Solution**

1. **Context/Situation** — What was happening; the scene
2. **Core Issue** — The friction point or misconception the speaker identified
3. **Deeper Understanding** — Examples, sub-patterns, why it matters; the "aha" moment
4. **Practical Approaches** — Concrete methods or mindsets that address the issue
5. **Synthesis** — What changed because of this; what it means going forward

**Template B: Misconception → Reality → Application**

1. **The Common Assumption** — What people usually think
2. **The Actual Pattern** — What the speaker discovered or observed
3. **Where It Shows Up** — Specific scenarios, types of people, contexts
4. **Implication** — Why this matters for how you work or think

**Template C: Layers of Complexity**

1. **Entry Level** — The surface-level version of the idea
2. **Next Layer** — A more nuanced or demanding version
3. **Advanced Version** — The subtlety that separates effectiveness from mediocrity
4. **Closing Thought** — What ties it together

**Template D: Custom Narrative**

- When none of the above fit, follow the audio's natural logical sequence
- Maintain clear transitions between thought clusters

### Section Headers

- Use **bold, second-level headers (`##`)** only for major topic shifts
- Headers should be short (2–5 words), drawn directly from speaker's language or concepts, never invented
- No preamble before the first header; article begins directly with content
- Headers should be sufficiently distinct that a reader scanning them sees the logical arc

### Paragraph Construction

- **Maximum 450 characters per paragraph** (including spaces)
- Each paragraph expresses one complete thought; merge related points rather than split them
- **Aim for 2–5 sentences per paragraph**; occasionally 1 sentence is acceptable for emphasis or stark contrast
- Vary sentence length: intersperse short (5–8 word) sentences with medium (12–18 word) ones
- Use natural transitions through topic flow, not explicit connectors; let ideas follow logically from one another

## Content Transformation Rules

### Compression & Density

- **Target**: Approximately 1 written sentence per minute of audio (rough guideline)
- Strip conversational fillers ("well," "um," "you know," "like," false starts, redundant elaborations)
- Preserve the complete logical chain—**never skip a causal step**
- Consolidate repeated ideas into single, cleaner statements
- Keep the voice natural; don't oversharpen into stilted brevity

### Specificity & Concreteness

- **Retain all concrete details**: numbers, examples, scenarios, team roles, timeframes, brand names, technical tools
- Never invent or generalize away specific instances the speaker mentioned
- When the speaker gives an example (even a passing one), preserve its specificity—it grounds abstract claims
- If the speaker uses analogies or metaphors, keep them; they carry meaning

### Logical Flow & Reordering

- Follow the speaker's original sequence unless reordering significantly improves clarity _and_ maintains causal relationships
- If you do reorder, ensure readers still understand _why_ one idea leads to the next
- Add minimal bridging language only when the speaker's logic jumps and context is genuinely lost
- Trust the speaker's progression; they usually order thoughts intentionally

### Narrative Devices (Use Sparingly, Authentically)

- Include contrast ("before/after," "the easy way vs. the hard way") where the speaker used it
- Use a rhetorical question only if the speaker asked one
- Preserve unexpected insights or surprises the speaker expressed (e.g., "и это в 2019 году!" → reveal something notable when it emerges)
- Keep moments of self-awareness, irony, or hard truth that show the speaker's honesty

## Style Guidelines

### Sentence Craft

- **Mix sentence structure**: Some short (5–8 words), others longer (18–25 words), occasional complex ones with em dashes or subordinate clauses
- **Prefer active voice**; use passive only when the speaker did or when it serves emphasis
- **Use em dashes (—)** for asides, elaborations, or second thoughts; it's natural in Russian
- Avoid academic jargon, corporate clichés, or bureaucratic phrasing
- Keep vocabulary conversational but professional; assume reader knows the domain

### What to Avoid

- Listicles, bullet-point lists, or summary reductions (use prose paragraphs)
- Repetition of the same idea in different words
- Marketing-speak, motivational clichés ("you've got this," "believe in yourself"), or hype language
- Hedging language that weakens claims ("perhaps," "it seems," "one could argue")
- Repetitive paragraph openings or structural patterns (don't start each paragraph the same way)
- Filler words and weak intensifiers that appear in speech but not in writing
- A separate introduction or conclusion grafted outside the main content; the article should feel integral
- Long lists of synonymous sub-points; merge them into a single, sharper statement

### Vocabulary Precision

- Use the specific terms the speaker used (Customer Support, Developer, Project Manager, etc.)
- Define technical terms only if the speaker did; assume domain familiarity
- Prefer direct, common Russian words over formal or imported equivalents where available
- Avoid diminutives, excessive diminishment ("всего-то"), or patronizing tone

## Formatting

- Use Markdown code block for final output
- Bold section headers with `*text*`
- **No introductory preamble** before the first section header
- **No bibliography or external source list**
- Natural paragraph breaks (double line break between paragraphs)
- No foototes, author bio, or sign-off outside the article body

## Quality Checklist (Self-Verify Before Finalizing)

- [ ] Every section header corresponds to actual content from the audio (not invented)?
- [ ] No paragraph exceeds 450 characters?
- [ ] All specific names, numbers, dates, and examples are accurate and preserved?
- [ ] Logical chain is complete; no causal steps skipped?
- [ ] Zero prescriptive commands ("you must," "you should") present?
- [ ] Voice reads like a thoughtful peer sharing experience, not a consultant or instructor?
- [ ] Sentence length varies; no repetitive patterns?
- [ ] Active voice dominates; passive voice used only intentionally?
- [ ] No marketing clichés, hedging language, or filler words?
- [ ] Conclusion synthesizes or reflects on impact, not merely repeating earlier points?
- [ ] Zero invented details or examples?
- [ ] Output formatted as Markdown code block, ready to paste?

## Thinking & Meta-Reflection

- Reflect on clarity and authenticity after drafting; consider whether a peer would find it useful and genuine.
