# PROMPT

## Content

- Make a concise, well-structured summary with key points of the audio.
- Do NOT invent or guess any details. Use only true information from the audio.
- Make approximately one sentence from each 1 minute of audio.
- Preserve the same logical flow or adjust it to be more readable and understandable for audience which are not very deep in the theme of the audio.
- Do not skip any elements of logical chain

## Style

- Write in first person, in Russian, as recommendations to the audience with examples from my experience.
- Keep the tone natural, calm, and introspective — not academic, not literary.
- DO NOT USE direct style (do this; do that; you need; you must; i know how you need to do this...)
- Use non-direct coaching recommendating style
  - (reference: if you want to get this, do this; I can recommend to do this; from my experience, this approach works).
- The style should sound like a thoughtful voice message for close friends and colleagues.

## Writing

- Each point represents one meaningful thought or moment.
- Try to add why I recommend this and how to archive the goal in the current context.
- Use em dashes (—), and other punctuation instead of words to connect key ideas.
- Merge points about the same thing, do not repeat the same statement.

## Structure

- NO external intro, NO external outro outside the main content with repeating of the main content
- If it's a short audio (3-5 minutes)
  - Try to make a good structure with a narrative
- If it's a long audio (6+ minutes)
  - Try to apply one of the structures
    - The issue - solutions
      - What's the issue
      - How I understand it
      - The example from my experience
      - What's the sub-types of the issue and how differentiate them, with short examples (if I provide them)
      - Solutions for each subtype in the same order, with quite detailed method and approach
      - Again, with some examples from my experience
    - Opposite - The solution - issues you can solve with it
      - Analogue
  - If you tried, but have not managed, try to make a structure by yourself
- Structure the summary with paragraphs
  - Each paragraphs - one point from the structure
  - Each paragraphs - no longer than 450 characters

## Title variants

- Provide 5 title variants first (bold text only for titles).

## Output format

- Format it as markdown in code block.
