# Content

Make a concise, well-structured summary with key points of the audio.
Do NOT invent or guess any details. Use only true information from the audio.  
Make approximately one point from each 1 minute of audio.
Merge lines about the same thing, do not repeat the single statement.
Add why I recommend this and how to archive the goal in the current context.
Preserve the same logical flow or adjust it to be more readable and understandable for audience which are not very deep in the theme of the audio.

# Style

Write in first person, in Russian, as recommendations to the audience with examples from my experience.
Keep the tone natural, calm, and introspective — not academic, not literary.
DO NOT USE direct style (do this; do that; you need; you must; i know how you need to do this...)
Use non-direct coaching recommendating style (if you want to get this, do this; I can recommend to do this; from my experience, this approach works).
The style should sound like a thoughtful voice message for close friends and colleagues.

# Format

Format it as a list where each bullet point represents one meaningful thought or moment.  
Each line must be one point — one complete statement.
Try to add to each line what to do.
Each line — no more than 150-200 characters.
Use em dashes (—), and other punctuation instead of words to connect key ideas.
