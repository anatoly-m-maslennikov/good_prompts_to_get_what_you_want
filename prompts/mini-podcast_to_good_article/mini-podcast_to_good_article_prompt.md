# The prompt

## Content

- Make a concise, well-structured summary with key points of the audio.
- DO NOT invent or guess any details. Use only true information from the audio.
- Make approximately one sentence from each 1 minute of audio.
- Preserve the same logical flow or adjust it to be more readable and understandable for audience which are not very deep in the theme of the audio.
- Do not skip any elements of logical chain

## Style

- Write in first person, in Russian, as recommendations to the audience with examples from my experience.
- Keep the tone natural, calm, and introspective — not academic, not literary.
- DO NOT USE direct style (do this; do that; you need; you must; i know how you need to do this...)
- Use non-direct coaching recommendating style
  - (reference: if you want to get this, do this; I can recommend to do this; from my experience, this approach works).
- The style should sound like a thoughtful voice message for close friends and colleagues.

## Writing

- Each point represents one meaningful thought or moment.
- Try to add why I recommend this and how to archive the goal in the current context.
- Use em dashes (—), and other punctuation instead of words to connect key ideas.
- Merge points about the same thing, do not repeat the same statement.

## Structure Overview

### Structuring Principles

- Structure the summary with paragraphs
- NO external intro, NO external outro outside the main content with repeating of the main content
- Determine the appropriate structure based on audio length and content
- Each paragraph represents one point from the structure
- Each paragraph should be no longer than 450 characters
- Use bold headers to mark main sections (e.g., Situation, Problem Statement)

### For Short Audio (3-5 minutes)

- Try to make a good structure with a narrative flow

### For Long Audio (6+ minutes)

- Analyze the content and apply one of these logical structures:

#### Structure Type 1: Problem → Analysis → Solution

1. Situation — describe the initial context or situation
2. Where is the issue here for you — what's the issue, what challenges arise
3. How I understand and map this — how I understand it, examples from my experience, sub-types of the issue with differentiation and short examples
4. What I can ecommend — solutions for each subtype in the same order, with detailed methods and approaches, examples from my experience
5. Conclusion — synthesis, final thoughts (what you'll gain from it, what's next)

#### Structure Type 2: Current State → Solution → Applications

1. Current State — describe what exists now or common approach
2. The Solution — the alternative approach or method
3. Applications — what issues you can solve with it, with examples
4. Conclusion — synthesis, final thoughts (what you'll gain from it, what's next)

#### Structure Type 3: Custom Narrative

- If the above structures don't fit, create a logical structure that follows the natural flow of the audio content
- Always maintain clear sections that guide the reader through the thought process

### Structuring Principles

- Structure the summary with paragraphs
- Each paragraph represents one point from the structure
- Each paragraph should be no longer than 450 characters
- Use bold headers to mark main sections (e.g., Situation, Problem Statement)

## Output Format

- Format it as markdown in code block
-
- Follow with structured content using headers 2 for section headers
- Maintain paragraph breaks and em dashes for flow
