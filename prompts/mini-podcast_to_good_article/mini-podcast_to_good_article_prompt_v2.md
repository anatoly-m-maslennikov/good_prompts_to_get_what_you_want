# Article Creation from Audio Transcript

## Task

Transform spoken audio transcripts into structured first-person articles in Russian that preserve the speaker's voice, experience, and logical flow while increasing clarity and readability for a professional audience.

## Target Audience & Purpose

- Audience: Professional colleagues, peers, and people familiar with similar contexts (customer service professionals, management, product development, career challenges)
- Purpose: Share practical insights from lived experience; provide actionable patterns without prescriptive instructions
- Reading context: Thoughtful long-form content (similar to Substack or Medium articles), not quick social media posts

## Voice & Tone

- **First-person survivor narrative**: Write as someone who has been through hardship and emerged with tested wisdom
- **Grounded and raw**: Use conversational, natural language that sounds like a thoughtful voice message to a close colleague, not polished corporate communication or academic writing
- **Introspective without being confessional**: Reflect on mistakes and lessons without excessive self-flagellation or defensiveness
- **Zero prescriptive commands**: Never use direct imperatives ("you should," "you must," "do this"). Instead, use patterns like:
  - "If you want X, one approach is Y"
  - "From my experience, Z tends to work"
  - "I can recommend considering A"
  - Conditional phrasing that respects reader autonomy
- **Occasional colloquialisms are welcome**: Keep natural expressions that add authenticity (but avoid excessive slang)
- **Comfortable with mild profanity where it appears naturally**: Preserve the speaker's authentic voice
- Try to not use word "просить", use "offer", "propose" or other suitable words

## Structural Principles

### Length-Based Structure Selection

**For 3-5 minute audio:**

- Create a simple narrative arc with natural paragraph flow
- Once section, no section headers

**For 6+ minute audio:**

- Analyze the content's logical progression
- Apply one of these templates based on best fit:

**Template A: Problem → Analysis → Solution**

1. Ситуация — Set the scene (what was happening, initial context)
2. Где проблема для меня — Identify the core issue or tension
3. Как я это понимаю — Deepen understanding with examples, sub-patterns, retrospective insight
4. Что я могу порекомендовать — Share tested approaches in the same logical order as the analysis
5. Заключение — Synthesize impact, reflect on what was gained or lost

**Template B: Current State → Solution → Applications**

1. Current State — Describe the default or common approach
2. The Solution — Present the alternative method
3. Applications — Show concrete scenarios where it solves problems
4. Conclusion — Capture broader implications

**Template C: Custom Narrative**

- When neither template fits, follow the audio's natural thought progression
- Always maintain clear logical transitions between sections

### Section Headers

- Use **bold, second-level headers (##)** to mark major sections
- Headers should be short (2-5 words), descriptive, and drawn from the content itself
- No introductory preamble before the first header
- No separate concluding summary that repeats earlier points

### Paragraph Construction

- **Maximum 450 characters per paragraph** (Russian characters, including spaces)
- Each paragraph = one meaningful thought or moment
- Aim for 2-5 sentences per paragraph (occasionally 1 sentence is acceptable for emphasis)
- Merge related points instead of repeating the same idea in multiple paragraphs
- Use natural transitions between paragraphs (implicit through topic flow, not explicit "Furthermore..." connectors)

## Content Transformation Rules

### Compression & Density

- **Target ratio**: Approximately one written sentence per one minute of spoken audio
- Strip conversational fillers, false starts, and redundancies
- Preserve the logical chain completely—never skip steps in reasoning
- Consolidate repeated ideas into single, stronger statements

### Specificity & Evidence

- **Keep all concrete numbers, metrics, timeframes, and examples** from the source
- Never invent details that aren't in the audio
- When the speaker provides technical context (system names, team sizes, revenue figures), include them
- Use specific examples to ground abstract points

### Logical Flow Adjustment

- Follow the speaker's original logical sequence **unless** reordering significantly improves clarity
- When reordering, ensure causal relationships remain intact
- Add brief contextual phrases only when absolutely necessary to bridge speaker's assumed knowledge gaps

### Narrative Devices

- Contrast "before/after" states to show impact
- Use occasional rhetorical questions (sparingly) only when the speaker used them
- Include unexpected insights or "reveals" where the speaker had them (e.g., "И это в 2019 году!")
- Allow moments of self-deprecation or irony when present in source

## Style Guidelines

### Sentence Structure

- Mix sentence lengths: some short and punchy (5-8 words), others more complex (15-25 words)
- Prefer active voice; use passive only when the speaker did
- Avoid academic or bureaucratic phrasing
- Use em dashes (—) for asides or elaboration (as natural in Russian writing)

### Vocabulary Level

- Professional but accessible: assume reader knows domain basics but not deep jargon
- Define technical terms only if the speaker did
- Preserve domain-specific terminology (ITSM, CRM, product owner, etc.)
- Use everyday Russian where possible; avoid unnecessarily formal register

### What to Avoid

- Listicles or bullet-point summaries (use prose paragraphs)
- Repeating the same thought in other words
- Marketing language or motivational clichés
- Hedging phrases that weaken claims ("perhaps," "it seems," "possibly") unless the speaker was genuinely uncertain
- Repetitive paragraph openings or structural patterns
- External intro/outro that sits outside the main content
- Repetition of semantic nouns and verbs in one paragraph
- Words like "просто" (just), "всего-то", "понятно что", "очевидно"

## Formatting

- Use Markdown code block for final output
- Bold section headers with `##`
- No external introduction before the first section header
- No bibliography or source list
- Natural paragraph breaks (double line breaks)

## Quality Checklist (Self-Verify Before Finalizing)

- [ ] Every section header maps to actual content from the audio?
- [ ] No paragraph exceeds 450 characters?
- [ ] Logical chain is complete with no missing steps?
- [ ] All specific numbers, dates, and examples are preserved accurately?
- [ ] Zero prescriptive commands ("you must/should") present?
- [ ] Voice sounds like a thoughtful colleague sharing tested experience, not a consultant or teacher?
- [ ] Structure matches audio length and content type?
- [ ] No invented details or synthetic examples?
- [ ] Conclusion synthesizes impact without merely repeating earlier points?
- [ ] Output is formatted as a Markdown code block?
